A simple game using pretty basic concepts of Python, a little system programming (in Python)
and with some ASCII art.

Things to add in the future:
1.	Add an asynchronous skipping-intro method:
		The game doesn't wait for the user to press 'q' to skip the intro,
		it keeps showing the intro, while in the background it asynchronously 
		waits for the input.
		If the input is 'q', then it skips the statements below, and shows the complete
		intro in one go.
